=============

http://stockpredictr.appspot.com code from
https://code.google.com/p/stockpredictr

I've moved the code to github to be with all the rest of my recent
coding.  I had to migrate to the High-Replication Datastore and I had
to fix a couple of bugs, so I took this opportunity to migrate the
code, too.  Do all the things!

What is stockpredictr?
======================

This site is a place for challenging your friends to a friendly
competition. See who can pick the closest price to a stock's closing
price.

At work, we often have a little fun trying to guess the stock price
movement after we announce quarterly results. You might think this is
simple, but you would be wrong! The stock price often behaves in quite
unexpected ways! Try it out and see for yourself.
